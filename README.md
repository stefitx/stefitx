  🌸 hi, i'm Stefi – rather a coding enthusiast than connoisseuse, currenly navigating the 42 cursus at 42Barcelona find me as atudor on the intra. #piscineofaugust2023
  🌼 lmao i didn't have any prior coding experience, just sending my computer good vibes and hoping for the best.
  🌞 i'd like to finish the common core in a year, but don't quote me on it. probably spending half that time wondering why deephought can be such a hater sometimes.
  🌟 but i love coding! it's the same as writing poems! 🌸
