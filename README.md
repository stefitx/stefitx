  🌸 hi, i'm Stefi – a coding enthusiast, currently navigating the 42 cursus at 42Barcelona. find me as atudor on the intra. #piscineofaugust2023
  🌼 i didn't have any prior coding experience, just showing up and hoping for the best.
  🌞 i'd like to finish the common core in a year, but don't quote me on it.
  🌟 i love coding! it's similar to writing poems! 🌸
